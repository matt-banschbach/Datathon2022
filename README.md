### Team Members: Sarah Motteler, Jonah Yi, Matt Banschbach


### Project Description
  We chose to use the loan dataset and explored the relationships between variables we thought were important. We focused on race, ethnicity, and debt to income ratio. After examining and cleaning the data, we produced three visual models illustrating the relationships of the variables above and whether or not the application loan was accepted. This project has been a great learning experience for all of us, in both the technical and conceptual side of data analysis and data science.
